        <h4><a id="a" name="a"></a>Why create priceTrackr?</h4>

        <div class="answer">
          <p>priceTrackr was created so that one can make a more
          informed decision before purchasing items on Newegg.</p>
        </div>

      <div class="faq">
        <h4><a id="b" name="b"></a>Why are there holes for some
        dates in the charts?</h4>

        <div class="answer">
          <p>Holes can appear in a chart for a few reasons. A crawl
          of Newegg may not have occurred on that date, an error
          may have occurred while crawling a specific item, or an
          item was placed in a deactivated state on Newegg. Except
          for in the case of a deactivated item, it should be
          pretty easy to extrapolate what the prices on the missing
          dates were.</p>
        </div>

      <div class="faq">
        <h4><a id="c" name="c"></a>How should the charts be
        interpreted?</h4>

        <div class="answer">
          <p>Each chart has four lines. The first line, "original",
          is the price one of the item in the absence of savings,
          rebates and shipping. The second line, "+ savings", is
          the price after Newegg's instant savings on the item.
          This is the cost to purchase the item, when not
          considering the cost of shipping. The third line, "+
          rebates", is the previous price with any rebates also
          added on. The final line, "original + shipping", allows
          one to track the variance in shipping over time with
          respect to the original price.</p>

          <p>The best way to look at the specific pieces is to
          compare them to the other lines. When "+ savings" differs
          from the original, then at that point in time there was
          savings on the item. Likewise when "+ rebates" differs
          from "+ savings" there was rebates on the item.</p>

          <p>The reason for comparing the shipping to the original
          price, rather than to tack on after the rebates price is
          that the original price varries much less than the
          rebates price, therefore it is simpler to monitor
          variations in the shipping price as is.</p>

      <div class="faq">
        <h4><a id="d" name="d"></a>How is the daily drops page
        sorted?</h4>

        <div class="answer">
          <p>The daily drops page is sorted in descending order
          based on the computed drop score each item receives. The
          drop score is computed by taking the cost drop of an item
          (yesterday's price - today's price) and multiplying that
          with the percent drop of an item (cost drop / yesterday's
          price).</p>

      <div class="faq">
        <h4><a id="e" name="e"></a>What does priceTrackr use to
        make the awesome charts?</h4>

        <div class="answer">
          <p>priceTrackr uses <a href=
          "http://www.maani.us/charts4/">XML/SWF Charts</a> version
          4.7 to make the awesome charts.</p>
