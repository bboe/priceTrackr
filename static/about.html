      <h1>About priceTrackr</h1>

      <h2>Original History (2006-2007)</h2>

      <p>The idea for priceTrackr was originally conceived by Bryce
      Boe on July 22, 2006 while procrastinating the writing of a
      paper. Bryce had recently purchased parts for a new desktop
      system and thought it would have been nice to have a service
      which allows one to make more informed decisions about the
      items they're purchasing. Having a little money in pocket the
      domain name "thepricetracker.com" was registered.</p>

      <p>After a few more days of procrastination, a Newegg crawler
      was written and the first data was collected for 20 items at
      10:37 PM PST on July 31st from Bryce's home computer. The
      first data set did not include savings, rebates or shipping
      prices and the crawler was adapted to collect this
      information. Regular data collection began August 4,
      2006.</p>

      <p>Upon discussing the idea with some friends, a suggestion
      was made to register "pricetrackr.com" to mimic sites like
      flickr. Thus on August 7, 2006 the domain was registered and
      the name was changed to "priceTrackr". The next day a
      <em>very cheap</em>, shared web host was purchased to host
      Bryce's various websites.</p>

      <p>A few weeks passed by before Bryce thought priceTrackr was
      ready to go. The night of August 27, 2006 he <a href=
      "http://www.bryceboe.com/2006/08/27/official-pricetrackr-launch/">
      blogged about priceTrackr</a>, though this blog posting had
      hardly any impact as very few people visited his blog at the
      time.</p>

      <p>On September 5, 2006 Bryce thought it was time to let the
      world know about priceTrackr. Utilizing digg he <a href=
      "http://www.digg.com/tech_deals/Newegg_priceTrackr">linked</a>
      to his blog posting with great skepticism. To his surprise
      priceTrackr reached digg's front page on September 6, 2006
      and very shortly there after Bryce's web server became a
      victim of the digg effect. A more detailed recollection of
      this event can be read <a href=
      "http://www.bryceboe.com/2006/09/07/a-day-with-digg-pricetrackr-was-dugg/">
      here</a>.</p>

      <p>Within a few days caching was enabled and the digg effect
      subsided allowing priceTrackr to resume normal operation,
      which it did for nearly four months. On January 5, 2007
      priceTrackr's hosting company explicitly stated that the
      update scripts (crawler) was not to run anymore, thus ending
      priceTrackr for the foreseeable future.</p>

      <h2>Relevant History (2008)</h2>

      <p>Though priceTrackr was lying dormant online for nostalgic
      purposes, not all of its code went unused. The Newegg
      crawler, written in the python programming language, was used
      as the basis for a highly distributed web crawler, CRAWL-E.
      CRAWL-E was in the data collection parts of a few research
      projects with more to come.</p>

      <h2>Current History (2009+)</h2>

      <p>After years of priceTrackr wanting to get priceTrackr back
      up and running, but having neither reason nor the resources
      to do so, Bryce finally received the resources and some time
      for making it happen. priceTrackr's Newegg crawler was
      updated to use the CRAWL-E framework and began crawling
      November 15, 2009. This time around priceTrackr doesn't just
      crawl a few items from Newegg, but rather nearly 100% of
      Newegg's items.</p>

      <p>priceTrackr was reintroduced into the wild on November 10,
      2009... (more to come)</p>
